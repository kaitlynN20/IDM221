#IDM 221: CONTENT INVENTORY

###About Me:

My name is Kaitlyn Nunez and I am in my third year at Drexel University. I used to be in the Game Art major but I recently switched into the Interactive Digital Media major. I still have a passion for making video games. However, I feel like web and app development is more in tune to what I want to do in the future. I am excited to learn all I can.

A few of my hobbies include watching movies, playing video games, dance. and Color Guard. I have a lot of favorite movies. A few of them are The Nightmare Before Christmas, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and Whiplash. I like first person shooter and narrative-intensive games. My favorite is The Wolf Among Us. Dance is a big passion of mine, I love the gracefulness and beauty that comes with dancing. Color Guard is one of my other passions. It's a whole other world people aren't aware of and its really cool.

I also like tv shows. I think that they are very smart and I draw a lot of inspiration from them. Shows like Steven Universe and Adventure Time break genres and shows others that children's shows don't have to treat the kids like they're not intelligent. I hope to create things similar to that, something that breaks the rules and inspires others to follow.

I really want to travel the world and explore different cultures and lands. There is so much more to the world than where I live and I hope I can experience that. I want to have that influence in my work. The world is so beautiful. I want to go to Paris, Greece (Greek Mythology is awesome), Rome, Japan, The Netherlands, and so many more places.

#####Experience

**Novermber 2014-September 2015**
Crew Member | Mcdonalds | U.S. Route 22, NJ

As a crew member, I worked during the lunch rush every shift and had to handle not only taking orders but also making sure all the meals are correct and each customer is left happy and satisfied. I also trained new crew members and was often used as an example of a model employee.  

**June 2014-August 2014**
Assistant Instructor | Somerville Color Guard | Somerville High School

I dedicated my time in the afternoons to assist my coaches during practice. I took members to the side and taught them routines. I also would take a section of the team and run basics when the coaches were busy. I also came up with small dance routines for the members to do in their shows.

**August 2016-Present**
Team Leader | Kiwi Frozen Yogurt | 3606 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104

I began work as a regular team member. After only working there for less than a month, I was promoted to team leader. I am in charge of the other team members. They come to me when they have problems and I guide them to make sure they are doing their jobs properly. I prepare the registers in the morning and in the afternoon.
