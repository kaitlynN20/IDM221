			<h2> October 8th 2016-First Night/Day</h2>
				<p>I never thought I would be fostering. I had just started my job and Ive been wanting a cat for such a long time now. My good friend was going to P.A.W.S to get his cat. I went with him for company but ended up filling out the forms. Then I just talked myself into picking up one with him. 
				</p>

				<p>He knew which one he wanted right away, I on the other hand had a harder time. There was so many kitties that needed fostering. There was one orange cat named Crush. He was beautiful and needed help with human interaction. His only interaction at the shetler was humans giving medicine. Than there was territoral Sweet Pea who bit me when I got to close to her toys. I knew I wasn't ready for Sweet Sea. I was going to pick Crush until I noticed one kitty in a cage. His tag said he has been in the shelter since august. I then asked the lady about his story.</p>

				<p>His name is Maddox. When he came into the shetler they put in the kitty cafe. He was doing okay there until he started getting antsy. He wasn't playing well. So they decided to put him in one of the rooms in the shetler. However he started to get depessed. The lady at the shelter assumed it was because he didn't like the other cats or shelter life. Finally they had to put him in a cage. Which made him even sadder and thats where he was until I picked him up.</p>

				<p>I was nervous about taking him home. I wasn't sure if he would adjust to my studio or if he would get stressed out. To my happy surpise, he walked around my apartment like he owned the place. He was sniffing around and rolling around the carpet. He slept with me in the bed on the first night. I can't wait to get to know him. The picture was of him chilling on my sofa. </p>

			<h2> October 11th 2016-Maddox made a fort!</h2>
				<p>Boy does Maddox have a personality. He likes to act like he doesn't love attention, until you don't give him any and then he follows you around until you pet him. He also has this werid fascination with my front door. He meows when he is by the door. Like he is talking to someone. He refuses to listen to his name, doesn't even look my way if I call him.
				</p>

				<p>He did the cutest thing today. I layed a blanket on the couch just incase he was going to stratch it up.(spolier alert he does) A part of the blanket was touching the floor and somehow Maddox wrapped himself up in the blanket and he just chilled there. Until I bopped his body and he started playing with me. He bit my hand over the blanket. It was so cute</p>

				<p>Which led to my boyfirend putting a blanket over him while he slept and Maddox loved it. He actually got more comfortable. This cat really is something else.</p>

			<h2> October 17th 2016-Majestic AF</h2>
				<p>So today, giving him the medicine was really easy. He doesn't put up much of a fight anymore. Which makes it really easy. I'm almost done with giving him his medicine. He use to sneeze up a strom it was so cute. I'm kind of sad he stopped sneezing, One time he sneezed so hard that he got some air time and even scared himslef. His sneezing stopped though, which means he is getting better.</p>

				<p>I witnessed his first crazy. It happens all the time after he ate. He would start running around the apartment attack nothing. Pouncing at nothing and playing with everything. He started love biting me and playing with my hand. He doesn't bite hard so I know he is just playing.</p>

				<p>His eyes get really big too its so cute. He was laying in the sun today and he looked so majestic. The light gives his black fur a red tint.  Its very beautiful.</p>

			<h2> October 19th 2016-Sleepy Baby</h2>
				<p>I caught him biting his tail today! he was playing with it and chasing it like a dog. It was so adorable. Thats what he does when he goes to the front door. He meows when ever he is pouncing or attacking something. So now I know what he is finally attacking. What a dummy.
				</p>

				<p>I love how he greets me whenever I come home. He follows me everywhere and jumps up on stuff if I am near so I can notice him and pet him. If I am near the table he hops up just so he can rub against me. Such an attention hoger. We watched a movie together, I can only do this when isn't in crazy mode.</p>
