I really like this site. The user gets a feel for the style of the company immediately. I also like how the site does not compromise the design, even the little details are stylized. The one thing the website does not explain is who they are, which is a little confusing at a first glance. However, I really love how everything flows together. There's also "mini-games." Overall this is the future goal for my website. 

The navigation doesn't move and it creates a very open space. The background changes but it isn't drastic. They also have weird little animations for when the website isn't full screened.

I love the simplicity of this site. My brain works a little differently than the website intended. However, the flow of the website is magnificent and its so beautiful. The little bit of animation is very effective. I love how they keep the monochromatic colors but when you click to enlarge the photo it shows it in color. It really adds to the work.

The navigation is also really simple and allows the user to focus on the work.

I like the idea of the website and I like the way the artist work is represented. It changes the colors but still keeps with the theme. However, I got lost really easily and some buttons didn't go where I thought it would. Aesthetically the website is really nice and I would like to incorporate the work page into my own page.
