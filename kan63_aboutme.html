<body>
	<p>My name is Kaitlyn Nunez and I am in my third year at Drexel University. I used to be in the Game Art major but I recently switched into the Interactive Digital Media major. I still have a passion for making video games. However, I feel like web and app development is more in tune to what I want to do in the future. I am excited to learn all I can.</p>

	<p>A few of my hobbies include watching movies, playing video games, dance. and Color Guard. I have a lot of favorite movies. A few of them are The Nightmare Before Christmas, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and Whiplash. I like first person shooter and narrative-intensive games. My favorite is The Wolf Among Us. Dance is a big passion of mine, I love the gracefulness and beauty that comes with dancing. Color Guard is one of my other passions. It's a whole other world people aren't aware of and its really cool.

	<p>I also like tv shows. I think that they are very smart and I draw a lot of inspiration from them. Shows like Steven Universe and Adventure Time break genres and shows others that children's shows don't have to treat the kids like they're not intelligent. I hope to create things similar to that, something that breaks the rules and inspires others to follow.</p>

	<p>I really want to travel the world and explore different cultures and lands. There is so much more to the world than where I live and I hope I can experience that. I want to have that influence in my work. The world is so beautiful. I want to go to Paris, Greece (Greek Mythology is awesome), Rome, Japan, The Netherlands, and so many more places.</p>
