	<h3>Experience</h3>
		<h4>November 2014-Seprember 2015</h4>
			<p>Crew Member| Mcdonalds| U.S. Route 22, NJ</p>

			<p>As a crew member, I worked during the lunch rush every shift and had to handle not only taking orders but also making sure all the meals are correct and each customer is left happy and satisfied. I also trained new crew members and was often used as an example of a model employee.</p>

		<h4>June 2014-August 2014</h4>
			<p>Assistant Instructor| Somerville Color Guard| Somerville High School</p>

			<p>I dedicated my time in the afternoons to assist my coaches during practice. I took members to the side and taught them routines. I also would take a section of the team and run basics when the coaches were busy. I also came up with small dance routines for the members to do in their shows.</p>

		<h4>August 2016-Present</h4>
			<p>Team Leader| Kiwi Frozen Yogurt| 3606 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104</p>

			<p>I began work as a regular team member. After only working there for less than a month, I was promoted to team leader. I am in charge of the other team members. They come to me when they have problems and I guide them to make sure they are doing their jobs properly. I prepare the registers in the morning and in the afternoon.</p>
