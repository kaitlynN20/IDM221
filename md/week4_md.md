I changed what the problem was. I didn't know when we were putting our work on the master branch. I fixed it and added the work to the master branch. 

Everything was already linked to the css sheet except error.html in the Week 3 branch. I just added the new files to the master branch.

##CSS

The master style sheet defines the wrapper div that contains every pages contant and the nav bar.
